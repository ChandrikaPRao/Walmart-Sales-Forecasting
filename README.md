# Walmart-Sales-Forecasting
In this project, we predict the department-wide sales for each Walmart store using historical sales data.

Kaggle description:
You are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains a number of departments, and you are tasked with predicting the department-wide sales for each store.

In addition, Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data.

Please find the following files/folder:

1. data folder - it has the required input files
2. Sales_forecast.ipynb file that generates the predictions for the test data using the best model identified.
3. output.csv file has the predictions for the test data using the best model identified.
4. Project_report : Reports the findings for various models. I am still working on this one.
